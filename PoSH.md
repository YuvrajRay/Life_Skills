## Question 1

*What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?*
Sexual Harassment is a complex issue that can be caused by a variety of factors, including:

1. **Power dynamics**: Sexual harassment often occurs in situations where there is a power imbalance, such as between a supervisor and an employee or between a client and a employee. The person in the position of power may use their authority to intimidate or coerce the other person.
2. **Cultural norms**: Societal attitudes and beliefs which attribute certain behaviours to specific genders can contribute to sexual harassment.
3. **Lack of awareness**: Some individuals may not recognize their behaviour as harassment, especially if they have not been educated about what constitutes inappropriate behaviour. This can lead to unintentional harassment. For example, someone may not realize that making sexual jokes or comments in the workplace is inappropriate.
4. **Peer pressure**: In some cases, individuals may feel pressured to engage in harassing behaviour in order to fit in with a group or to gain acceptance from peers.
5. **Substance abuse**: Alcohol and drugs can impair judgment and lead to inappropriate behaviour, increasing the likelihood of sexual harassment.
6. **Lack of consequences**: If individuals believe that there will be no repercussions for their actions, they may be more likely to engage in harassing behaviour. This can create a culture of impunity where harassment is tolerated or ignored.
7. **Miscommunication**: Sometimes, individuals may misinterpret social cues or fail to recognize when their behaviour is unwelcome, leading to unintentional harassment. For example, someone may not be comfortable with physical touch or constant Praise, but the other person may not realize this and continue to engage in that behaviour.

## Question 2

*What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?*
1. **Document the incident**: Write down the details of the incident, including the date, time, location, and any witnesses present. This documentation can be helpful when I decide to report the behaviour.
2. **Speak up**: I will, confront the person who is engaging in the harassing behaviour. Let her/him know that their actions are inappropriate and unwelcome. 
3. **Report the behaviour**: If the behaviour continues or if I feel uncomfortable confronting the person directly, I will report the incident to a supervisor, human resources, or another appropriate authority within our organization. Provide them with the documentation that I have collected have collected.
