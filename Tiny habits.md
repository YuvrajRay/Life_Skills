# Tiny Habits

## Question 1
**In this video, what was the most intresting story or idea for you?**

The part where the speaker said that, "planting the seed at the place where it grows on its own is the best place to grow it". It had an eye opening effect on me regarding Habit formation.

## Question 2
**How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.**

In the expression B = MAP. 
* B = Behaviour
* M = Motivation
* A = Ability
* P = Prompt
  
We can build a new Behaviour only if we are Motivated enough, has the ability to do the work when the prompt is present.
For example : If someone wants to build the habit of reading before bed. S/he should be motivated to read, should decide to read enough that is challenging yet not impossible and should design prompt to read the book ( like keping the book in the night stand).

## Question 3
**Why it is important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of habit?**

Learning to "Shine"(celebrate) after a tiny win is the most critical component of habit development. It helps to develop Confidence and Motivation.

## Question 4
**In this video, what are the most intresting story or idea for you?**

The research which concluded that what we lack is not Motivation but Clarity caught my attention. I will use this to clearly plan my day, week and month.
Also, the 2 minute rule is quite helpful.

## Question 5
**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

To change our Habit we have to change our identity. For example- If we believe ourself to be "A healthy person" we will follow habits of a healthy person like eating balanced diet, exercising, etc.

## Question 6
**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**

It can be achieved using:
 1. Cue - Make it obvious, by changing our environment ( decrease steps between ourself and the good behavoiour).
 2. Craving - Make it attractive, that will make us crave it. Example - combine it with someing intresting activity
 3. Response - Make it easy, example If you want to read before bed, keep a book on your bed side table.
 4. Reward - What is immideately rewarded is repeated and what is immideately punished is avoided. Therefore reward yourself for successful completion of task.

## Question 7
**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**

It can be achieved using:
1. Cue - make the cue for bad behaviour tough, put mobile phone on silent while working.
2. Craving - Combine it with unpleasant, for example - must do 10 pushup after smoking.
3. Response - Make it hard to repeate the bad behaviour, example don't buy packets of cigarette
4. Reward - Immideate punishment after bad behaviour is effective in changing it.

## Question 8
**Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**

I would like to exercise more often. For this I will do stretching and pushup after brushing my teeth. I will also maintain a habit tracker to record my habit. And after this session I will "Shine" by patting myself in the back.

## Question 9
**Pick one habit that you would like to eleminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**

I would like to decrease my mobile phone screen time. For this I will only open my mobile phone for work and 1 hour entertainment. Also, I will take this 1 hour only after I complete all my daily tasks.
