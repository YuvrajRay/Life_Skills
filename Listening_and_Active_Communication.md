# Listening and Active Communication

## Question 1

*What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)*
1. Avoid getting distracted by your own thought. This may include thinking about something else, forming question or response to the speaker herself/himself. Instead focus on the speaker.
2. Try not to interrupt the other person, let them finish.
3. Use door openers, these are pharases that show that you are intrested. For example - asking questions that clear doubts or allows the speaker to talk more on the topic.
4. Show that you are listening with body language. This may include nodding or showing empathy.
5. Take notes if appropriate. During lecture or meeting, it would be a good idea to take notes.
6. Paraphrase, repeat what you understood in you own language, this reduces the chance of miscommunication. 

## Question 2

*According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)*

Reflective Listening is a method of listening in which the listener repeates what s/he has understood to the speaker herself/himself. This decreases chance of ambiguity and misunderstanding.
</br>It can be applied in meetings to correctly note down the specifics of the task given or steps to be taken.

## Question 3
*What are the obstacles in your listening process?*
</br>Sometimes I start forming response even before the speaker has finished speaking.


## Question 4
*What can you do to improve your listening?*
</br>I will start focusing on what the speaker is saying, any listen with the intent of learning not with that of replying.


## Question 5
*When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?*
</br>I generally switch to Passive communication style in my day to day life in the following conditions:
1. When I am happy and elated, I tend to do more than I generally do for other.
2. When dealing with someone close or whom I respect.


## Question 6
*When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?*
1. When I have told "NO" polietly to someone numerous times.
2. When someone crossess the line of decency.


## Question 7
*When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?*
</br>I mostly avoid doing these kind of things, but if someone herself/himself indulge in these things, I try to reply them in their own language. Although, while doing this I keep in mind not to escalate matters.


## Question 8
*How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)*
1. By making my needs more clear to others and to myself.
2. By practicing Assertive communication in low stake situations.
3. I will let people know immideately when they disrespect me.
